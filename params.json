{"name":"Battleship-java","tagline":"A java program to play Battleship against a smart computer!","body":"### Try Your Hand at Battleship!\r\nI wrote this Java program to play Battleship in the console/terminal my senior year of high school, along with my good friend Matt Loughney. This was one of my first programs ever, and to this day it's one I look back on incredibly fondly. Even though I know now it's not perfect, I'm incredibly proud of it! Hope you enjoy!\r\n\r\n### How To Play\r\nFirst, download the code! Once you have the files, compile and run the BattleShipClient.java file (on my machine, I do this in terminal with the command\r\n\r\n    javac BattleShipClient.java\r\n\r\nThen, just run\r\n\r\n    java BattleShipClient\r\n\r\nEnjoy!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
